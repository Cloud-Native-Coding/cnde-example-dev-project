# Example Application

In this tutorial, we are going to build a simple CRUD application to show how typical development with cloud- native-coding works.

I am using the following quite simple example [Build a simple app using Node JS and MySQL](https://dev.to/achowba/build-a-simple-app-using-node-js-and-mysql-19me)

## Steps to update Dev Env

### Install NodeJS and NPM

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

### Install VSCode Extension and Connect to DB

- install [VS-Code MySQL Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.vscode-mysql)
- create a new connection to host `stage-mysql`, user `root` and password `UyH2EccNqK`
- create DB and Table like written in the extension documentation
